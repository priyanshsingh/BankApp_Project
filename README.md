## Features
### Bug Fixes
- **Add Account API**: Fixed error propagation in the account creation process.
- **Account Details API**: Resolved issues with error handling during retrieval of account details.

### Eureka
- Service discovery and registration using Netflix Eureka.

### Config Server
- Centralized configuration management for all microservices using Spring Cloud Config Server.

### Security
- Implemented **Keycloak** for authentication and authorization to secure the APIs.

### Distributed Tracing
- Integrated **Zipkin** and **Sleuth** to enable distributed tracing of requests across microservices.

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus** for collecting metrics.
- **Grafana** for visualizing and monitoring the system health.

### API Documentation
- Generated API documentation using **Swagger** for easy interaction with available endpoints.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Java 11+**: Ensure that Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed.
- **Maven**: Required for building and managing project dependencies.
- **Docker**: To run containers for Eureka, Config Server, Keycloak, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
- **Keycloak**: For managing authentication and authorization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-app.git
   cd bank-app
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Start Keycloak** (Docker-based example):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin jboss/keycloak
   ```

4. **Start Eureka Server**:
   Navigate to the Eureka server module and run the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. **Start Config Server**:
   Navigate to the Config Server module and run:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

6. **Run Microservices**:
   Start the microservices by navigating to each service directory and running:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

---

## Configuration

### Spring Cloud Config
All microservices retrieve their configurations from a central **Config Server**. You can configure the settings in the `application.yml` files for each service or in a Git repository linked to the Config Server.

### Security with Keycloak
Ensure that Keycloak is properly configured with the required realms, clients, and roles. Update the Keycloak URL and credentials in the `application.yml` or `application.properties` files of the microservices to secure the endpoints.

---

## Running the Application

1. **Start Eureka**: Eureka will serve as the service registry.
2. **Start Config Server**: The Config Server should be started for centralized configuration.
3. **Start Microservices**: Start the account-related microservices.
4. **Access APIs**: Use tools like Postman or the Swagger UI to interact with the APIs.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing
- **Zipkin**: Access Zipkin to visualize request traces at `http://localhost:9411`.
  
### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Access Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090` to view collected metrics.
- **Grafana**: Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` to monitor the services visually.

---

## API Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger.

- **Swagger UI**: Visit the Swagger UI for your microservices at:
  ```
  http://localhost:{service-port}/swagger-ui.html
  ```
